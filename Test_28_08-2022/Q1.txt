Q1. Is react a framework or a library and what is the difference between the two?


Ans:

React is a Library.



Diffrence Between Framework & library

React (Libeary) vs Angular (Framework)

Library is small in size.

Framework is big in size.




React is faster compared with Angular and other frameworks.

In a framework, many things are built in.

In a library, it only contains the basics.

Example:

In React, API calls are not there, we import and axios. There is no routing by default, we need to use react-router.

In Angualar, all these things are built-in.

Libraries only contains the bare minimum that you need to get started. Anything extra, you need to install separately.
